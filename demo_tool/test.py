I need to analyze the provided code, but it seems there was an issue with the input. The code provided is just "aa" which is not valid Python code. 

To generate proper test functions, I need to see the actual Python code that needs to be tested. This should include function definitions, classes, or other code elements that require testing.

Please provide the actual Python code you'd like me to create tests for, and I'll generate appropriate test functions using the unittest framework.
