    result: "### Title: Latest News on US President Trump (2025/03/12)\n\n**Summary:** The recent developments regarding US President Donald Trump focus primarily on his upcoming meeting with Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin at the White House. Scheduled during the traditional St. Patrick's Day events, this meeting is particularly significant due to the pressing global issues at hand, notably the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. \n\nTaoiseach Martin has expressed his intention to discuss how Ireland can collaborate with the Trump administration to promote peace and stability in these regions. This meeting marks him as the first EU leader to visit the Oval Office since the controversy surrounding President Trump’s interactions with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. The discussions are expected to cover a wide array of topics, including the strong economic ties between the US and Ireland, highlighting Ireland's role as a major source of foreign direct investment in the US.\n\nAmidst rising economic tensions, particularly related to potential tariffs on EU imports which threaten to ignite a trade war, Martin aims to underline the mutual economic benefits of Irish-American relations. He is also set to address the current situation in Northern Ireland, acknowledging the US's crucial contribution to the peace process there.\n\nThe meeting comes at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty, and there are concerns about Trump's tariff policies, which have started to impact international relations and markets. The media's focus will also likely touch on Trump's hardline trade agenda, which has already raised alarm among allies and could exacerbate existing trade imbalances.\n\nOverall, the anticipation surrounding this meeting reflects a delicate balancing act for Martin, as he navigates domestic economic concerns and international diplomatic challenges while engaging with a controversial figure like Trump."

    result: '### Title: Latest Developments of AI Tool Manus (2025/03/12)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe recent launch of Manus, an advanced AI assistant developed by the Chinese startup Butterfly Effect, has garnered significant attention and enthusiasm within the technology community. Positioned as a powerful tool that transcends traditional chatbots, Manus is designed to autonomously perform complex tasks, such as booking tickets, sorting resumes, and even generating custom web applications. \n\nIntroduced in early March 2025, Manus stands out for its intuitive interface and practical capabilities, leading many to compare it to the groundbreaking AI tool DeepSeek. Co-founder Yichao "Peak" Ji has described Manus as a potential paradigm shift in human-machine collaboration, offering a glimpse into the future of artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\nCurrently available only through an invitation-only beta, Manus has rapidly gained traction, amassing over 170,000 members on its official Discord server. Early user feedback has been largely positive, with many praising its user experience and ability to efficiently execute tasks with minimal structure, which has been highlighted as a significant improvement over existing AI solutions. \n\nNotably, unlike other AI tools that operate within strict parameters, Manus has demonstrated a capacity for providing uncensored responses to sensitive topics, indicating a unique approach to information handling. This capability has led to discussions about its potential impact in areas requiring nuanced understanding, such as historical events and human rights issues.\n\nDespite its promise, experts caution that Manus success will depend on its ability to scale effectively while addressing technical stability and ethical concerns. The exclusivity of its current access model may hinder widespread adoption, potentially limiting its appeal compared to more open-source platforms like DeepSeek. The future of Manus as a major player in the enterprise automation space remains uncertain as it continues to evolve and improve.'
