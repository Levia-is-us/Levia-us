<code_breakdown>
The code contains one primary function exposed as a tool through the @run_tool class decorator:

1. save_markdown_to_gitbook (static method in SaveMarkdownToGitbook class)

Function signature:
def save_markdown_to_gitbook(content):

Parameters:
- content: No explicit type hint, but implied to be string (markdown content). Required. Used as input content to process.

Return value:
- Returns string (URL or error message). Type not explicitly declared but observable from returns.

Implementation summary:
Processes markdown input by:
1. Initializing GitBook and file management clients
2. Validating input content
3. Uploading markdown to Azure file storage
4. Importing content to GitBook space
5. Handling GitBook change requests
6. Returning final URL or error messages

Notable aspects:
- Uses global singleton instances for API clients
- Implicit string type handling without validation
- Complex error handling with file cleanup
- Relies on environment variables for configuration
- Returns different string formats for success vs error cases

Edge cases:
- Empty content input triggers immediate error
- API call failures roll back file uploads
- First organization/space selection might not be correct in multi-org accounts
- File naming collisions from get_top_title_with_hash
