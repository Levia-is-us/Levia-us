The analysis focuses on the ListAbilitiesTool class and its list_abilities method:

1. Identified Function:
   - list_abilities (method of ListAbilitiesTool class decorated via @run_tool class decorator)

2. Function Signature Analysis:
   - Signature: def list_abilities(self, **kwargs) -> dict
   - Parameters:
     - self: Implicit class instance reference (required)
     - **kwargs: Variable keyword arguments (optional)
   - Return Type: dict

3. Implementation Notes:
   - Relies on self.methods inherited from BaseTool (not shown in code)
   - Uses introspection to get method signatures
   - Contains error handling for signature extraction failures
   - Returns structured ability metadata including descriptions and signatures

4. Potential Issues:
   - Dependent on parent class implementation (self.methods and self.get_method_description)
   - **kwargs parameters are declared but not used in implementation
   - Signature detection might fail for non-standard methods (e.g., @classmethod)
