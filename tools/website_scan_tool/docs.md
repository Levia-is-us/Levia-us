Identified Function:
1. website_scan (method of WebsiteScanTool class)

Function Signature:
def website_scan(self, url_list: list, intent: str)

Parameters:
- url_list: list (required) - List of URLs to scan
- intent: str (required) - The intent to guide scanning

Return Value:
- Returns summary (output from get_summary_links) or error message
- Return type appears to be string based on error handling, but actual type depends on get_summary_links implementation

Purpose:
Scans websites by extracting links, removing duplicates, fetching content, and generating intent-based summaries

Notable Aspects:
1. Relies on multiple helper functions not shown in code
2. Specific exception handling for connection timeouts
3. Processes links recursively through get_all_links
4. Returns raw error message strings in some cases

Potential Issues:
1. Depends on external website accessibility
2. No visible timeout configuration
3. String-based error matching ("website connection timeout") is fragile
4. No validation for URL format in url_list
5. Recursive link crawling might cause infinite loops with circular references
